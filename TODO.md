## Notes on Things Not Done Yet

- [ ] pass to comment far-braces, use import *
- [ ] finish cleanup with Lookup.ClassesSomethingSomething
- [ ] num based on other than i32
- [ ] Parse should be to parse a str to num, bytes to num should be a Decode/Encode probably
- [ ] double buffering (or overall better rendering - maybe even.. *swing*?)
- [ ] annotation to make fun of a class
- [ ] 'help' for a function (with ret type and all)
- [ ] build a list of funs (eg. build step.. using the annotation..?)
- [ ] error handling (esp. Lang)
- [ ] loading obj from external jars
